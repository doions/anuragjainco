	<h1>Do single language can be your cup of tea?</h1>
	<p>
		Being a computer science student every individual is more stressed towards choosing which and how many computer
		languages to learnin order compete with the current competitive world. But the fact is really we don’t need to
		learn all the languages. Instead one language when learnt perfectly is what you need. Because one can’t learn all
		the languages. From the career perspective, and if you see from the programmers point of view if you are a
		good programmer, language is not a barrier for the programmer and you need not learn all the languages rather you
		need to become a good programmer in one language and then shift to different languages but you can’t start learning all
		languages within one go because the idea is to not master the language but to master the programming mind set (how
		to think in terms of algorithms).Every programming language is aligned on a specific type of problem. You will
		understand it once you get deep into the programming world. If you understand the law and basic principles of
		programming then the language is independent. But if you are beginner, I would suggest you to stick to one
		language and do asmany projects as you can do, do real life projects and get an experience of coding and make
		coding as a habit. Because coding is an art like singing and drawing . You have to reach to a level where you get
		to that zone of writing codes again and again so then it won’t need an effort to make it, it will come naturally
		where language is not a problem.
