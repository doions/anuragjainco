	<h1>Do single language can be your cup of tea?</h1>
	<p>
	Being a computer science student every individual is more stressedtowards choosing which and how many computer languages to learnin order compete with the current competitive world. But the fact isreally   we   don’t   need   to   learn   all   the   languages.   Instead   onelanguage   when   learnt   perfectly   is   what   you   need.  Because     onecan’t learn all the languages. From the career perspective, and ifyou   see   from   the   programmers   point   of   view   if   you   are   a   goodprogrammer, language is not a barrier for the programmer and youneed not learn all the languages rather you need to become a goodprogrammer in one language and then shift to diff languages butyou   can’t   start   learning   all  languages   within   one   go   because  theidea is to not master the language but to master the programmingmind set (how to think in terms of algorithms).Every   programming   language   is   aligned     on   a   specific   type   ofproblem.     You   will   understand   it   once   you   get     deep   into   theprogramming world.  If you understand the law and basic principlesof programming then the language is independent. But if you arebeginner I would suggest you to stick to one language and do asmany   projects   as   you   can   do,   do   real   life   projects   and   get   anexperience of coding and make coding as a habit. Because coding isan art like singing and drawing .  You have to reach to a level whereyou get to that zone of writing codes again and again so then itwon’t   need   an   effort   to   make   it,   it   will   come   naturally   wherelanguage is not a problem.
